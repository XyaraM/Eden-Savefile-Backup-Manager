# My personal savefile backup manager for the Eden emulator

Why?. Because i made a little whoops and erased some my savefiles on accident and instead of triggering and getting mad, i decided to make a python script for backing up the savefiles.

It stores the savefiles in compressed tar files inside the Eden root directory, creates a folder named "backups" and stores the files in there.
